Description: Signac is an algorithm that addresses the classification problem in single cell RNA sequencing. We often have an expression matrix and we need to classify the cells into their cell types and cell states based on their gene expression patterns. Note: v0.1.1 is an attempt to fix a bug where NK cells were being over-called relative to T cells.
